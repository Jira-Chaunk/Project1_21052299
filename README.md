Hi! I'm Abhishek Panda, a final year BTech student with a strong passion for data analysis and web development. This project marks my exciting journey into the world of web development!

This simple webpage serves as my online portfolio, designed and built using HTML and CSS. It's a testament to my initial steps in learning web development and showcases my basic understanding of front-end technologies.

Feel free to explore the page and get a glimpse into who I am!
